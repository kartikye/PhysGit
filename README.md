# PhysGit
PhysGit is for the lazy programmer. Instead of having to switch to cmd to use git, all you have to do to push is to literaly push, pull to pull, squash down to commit and draw circle to commit. PhysGit also connects to Growl to notify you when your got request is completed and on OSX it will talk to you.

Optional Dependencies: Growl Notifier and GNTP library.

Instructions:

1. open terminal/cmd/bash
2. cd into your project directory
3. run PhysGit.py using python /path/to/PhysGit.py
4. wave your hands around

To push - push
To pull - pull
To commit - swipe downeards
To merge - draw a circle with your finger
To stash - swipe left
