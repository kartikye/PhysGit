# PhysGit
PhysGit is for the lazy programmer. It enables you to use ‘the force’ to control Git (who doesn’t want to be Darth Coder!). ‘Pushing’ your arm over the Leap pushes your code. ‘Pulling’ your arm over the Leap pulls your code. ‘Swiping down’ stashes the code and ‘drawing a circle’ commits the code. 

Optional Dependencies: Growl Notifier and GNTP library.

Instructions:

1. open terminal/cmd/bash
2. cd into your project directory
3. run PhysGit.py using python /path/to/PhysGit.py
4. wave your hands around

To push - push
To pull - pull
To commit - swipe downeards
To merge - draw a circle with your finger
To stash - swipe left
